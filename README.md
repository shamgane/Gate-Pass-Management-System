# Gate-Pass-Management-System

This is a simple interface for institutions which issue a gatepass for hostel students while going out of the hostel.
It uses a basic HTML page for different screens and a MySQL Database locally setup at the backend. The connection requests are handled using PHP.
This prototype was created as a part of a mini project during undergrad.
